      <description>During my studies, I struggled to evaluate my productivity. The research years of my PhD were long and lacked structure. It felt as though I spent every day sitting in front of my computer slowly chipping away at the amorphous blob that was my thesis. I discovered Rescue Time and it totally changed my life!

      <description>Precision Analytics found a permament home in July 2017 at Nexus Coworking space. Before then, we were working out of our own homes or at coffee shops.
I track my personal spending, and I noticed a pretty strong &amp;lsquo;office effect&amp;rsquo; on having a permanent space to work - and make my own coffee! The y-axis is proportionate to the dollars I spent at cafes per month. Of course, the spending will probably never go to zero&amp;hellip;the lattes at le Darling are too good.</description>
